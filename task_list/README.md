## Project Tasks List

Day 01:
- Read [ProteinMPNN](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.03.494563v1) and [Cyclic peptide structure prediction and design using AlphaFold
](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.25.529956v1.full) for understanding project backgrounds.
- Project Literature Review

Day 02:
- Increase proficiency with the RFDiffusion model by generating hundreds of protein structures.
- Attempt to generate cyclic oligomer.
- Review Gram-Schmidt which is principle to maintain the cyclic property of the oligomer structure.

Day 03: 
- Find the best setting for icosahedral & octahedral structures by manipulating guiding potential values (e.g. weight_intra, weight_inter, guide_scale).
- Call for Proposal First Draft
